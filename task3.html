          Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the
          qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because
          every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men
          make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

        <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from
          science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science</p>

          What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

        <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather
          than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish
          her.</p>

          For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most
          certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which
          divide us.

          There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy
          the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

          The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict
          too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.

        <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process
          which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most
          beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched
          it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

          Space, the final frontier. These are the voyfidabasheer.github.io/task3.htmlages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new

          As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature,
          Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.
